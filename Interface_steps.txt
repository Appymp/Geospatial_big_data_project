Using the interface:

Notes about Version 6.3:
* All buttons are functional including the image export.
* When you run the script for the first time make sure to uncomment the #ee.Authenticate(). For subsequent runs, this canbe commented out to save time.
* The reference file instantiates the scope of the Sentinel bands coverage. Currently this covers Spain, France, and Italy. Loads directly in backend from the "reference" geojson file.
* Optimizations to the code and visual aesthetics pending.


Step 1: Upload the labelled dataset
	- Paste the table ID from the your Earth engine account console where you uploaded sigpac asset.


Step 2: Full scope geometry
	- Upload the geojson file "parcel" which is the outline of the sigpac geometry.
	- This is used for defining the training points and training export image.
	- For error checking, try uploading a zone out of the training area scope "work_zone_outscope".
	
Step 3: Training zone upload
	- This step is not mandatory. Defaults to full scope if not used.
	- If you want to check, you can upload "zone_insigpac" geojson which is a small area within the sigpac dataset which has approx 50% irrigated and non irrigated area.
	- For error checking, try uploading a zone out of the training area scope "work_zone_outscope".

Step 4: Train the model
	- The progress bar will indicate the training progress.
	- Usually trains in under 1 min.
	- Can try to upload the training zone after initially testing without.

Step 5: Export the taining
	- Set the scale and click the export button.
	- Type the filename in the popup entrybox. Example : "26_May_Urgell"
	- Details of pixels (px) and export scale (sc) are automatically appended to filename:
		"26_May_Urgell_train_px_20k_sc_20"
	- Progress bar indicates progress.
	- Takes about 6 mins for scale 30 and 13 mins for scale 5.
	- File is stored in your google drive associated with the earth engine console authentication.
	- Any errors are indicated with a popup message.

Step 6: Prediction Zone upload
	- Upload the "zone_pred_Occ" geojson. This is the boundary of Occitanie region.
	- This button both uploads and classifies the prediction area in the same step.
	- Any errors are indicated with a popup message.

Step 7: Export prediction:
	- Set the scale and click the export button.
	- Type the filename in the popup entrybox. Example : "26_May_Occitanie"
	- Details of pixels (px) and export scale (sc) are automatically appended to filename:
		"26_May_Occitanie_pred_px_20k_sc_20"
	- Progress bar indicates progress.
	- Takes about 48 min for scale 20 Occitanie region; 9000 pixels. 1 image 
		- 5:30 hrs for scale 5 Occitanie region; 20k pixels. 8 images.
		- 49 mins for scale 20 Occitanie region; 20k pixels. 1 image.
	- File is stored in your google drive associated with the earth engine console authentication.
	- Any errors are indicated with a popup message.
